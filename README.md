This code identifies gap buy and sell signals based on the conditions specified and includes logic to buy when the RSI is low and the price is near the lower Bollinger Band or when a gap up occurs. Similarly, it sells when the RSI is high and the price is near the upper Bollinger Band or when a gap down occurs. This strategy aims to capitalize on the tendency of prices to revert to their mean or continue in the direction of the gap.
